# Tuesday

## Overview
Tuesday is currently an initial project scaffold.

This repository does not yet include application source code, build scripts, or tests. The current purpose of this README is to document the repository state and provide a starting point for future development.

## Current Repository State
- `README.md`: project documentation (this file)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Add source files for your application (for example, under `src/`).
3. Add a dependency manager and run scripts as needed (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
4. Add tests and CI once core functionality is in place.

## Suggested Initial Structure
```text
.
├── README.md
├── src/
├── tests/
└── docs/
```

## Development Notes
- Keep this README updated as code and commands are added.
- Document setup, run, and test commands as soon as they exist.
- Add architecture notes in `docs/` when the codebase grows.
